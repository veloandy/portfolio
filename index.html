        <p>What's impressed me most about Andy is how he's not just technically competent, but he understands the 
          needs of the business too. His focus is always on just the right thing, whether it's implementing a new 
          feature to support a partner, adding a metric to address a hotspot, or refactoring code to make it easier 
          for the next engineer to read, Andy is on it. And <b>no matter how tedious or stressful the problem, he 
          tackles it with grace and a smile</b><br>...<br>
          the entire time I worked with him, nearly every engineer he worked with actively reached out to me and couldn't speak highly enough about
          Andy, from the most junior engineer to the most senior. Consensus was unanimous: <b>Andy is smart, creative, a solid coder, a fantastic writer, empathetic mentor, and just a joy to work with.</b></p>

                Railscast blew my mind. I was amazed at how easy and fun Rails made it
                to add professional features to my site. The built-in syntactic sugar
                is beautiful.
