      <div class="h2">Why take a year off?</div>
        <div class="row lead">
            <p>For the first time in my adult life I didn't have kids in the house. My wife's parents
            and my parents are still healthy and independent.  I'm still healthy and fit enough to 
            do active outdoor activies. I was at a nexus point in my career. I had just read "Die with Zero"
            and this quote really resonated with me</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="columns small-3">
                <blockquote>“That is what I mean when I say that we die many deaths in the course of our lives: The teenager in you dies, the college student in you dies, the single unattached you dies, the version of you that’s a parent of an infant dies, and so on. Once each of these mini-deaths occurs, there’s no going back. Maybe “dies” is a bit harsh, but you get the idea: We all keep moving forward, progressing from one stage or phase of our lives to the next.”

            <p>I realized that this was the first time, and maybe the only time in my
                life I had so much freedom and opportunity to take some time off and
                do all the things I had always fantasized about.  So I decided to do
                it before the "current me" dies.  This page documents some of the things I
                managed to do with this precious time.

                    <h3>Camping with my mom <small>5/28/2024</small></h3>
                    <p>Goosenecks State Park, UT</p>
                    <p><img src="assets/sabbatical/goosenecks.jpeg"></p>
                    <p>Drove the VW Westy to Albuquerque, picked up my mom, and headed toward Moab for Syncro Solstice!</p>
                    <p>The night before we left Albuquerque, I saw a message on <a target="_blank" href="https://thesamba.com">TheSamba</a>
                        that a couple with a Vanagon with a Subaru engine swap was stranded in Kayenta, AZ.  My mom and I stopped to 
                        help on our way.  I got their van going. It turned out the problem was just a deceptively blown fuse! The couple
                        was on vacation from Canada and really nice.  It turns out they own 
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://coastalcampfires.com/">Costal Campfires</a>. I think we saved their vacation.</p>
                    <p>My mom and I stopped at Monument Valley and continued on to Goosenecks State Park.  I had never been there, and it
                        was spectacular.  I'd definitely return!

                    <h3>Syncro Solstice <small>6/1/2024</small></h3>
                    <p>Island In The Sky, outside of Moab, UT</p>
                    <p><img src="assets/sabbatical/syncrosolstice.jpeg"></p>
                    <p>I love going to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheSyncroSolstice/">The Syncro Solstice</a> every year. It's an event at a spectacular group campground outside of Moab for Volkswagen vans. Every year 75 or 100 vans show up.<p>
                    <p>By day, everyone breaks into smaller caravans that tackle offroad trails together. Two wheel drive vans like mine are welcome, and it's amazing to see what they can do. It's especially amazing when everyone is accompanied by a team of vans to help recover someone if they get into trouble. The ugliest four wheel drive vans tackle the gnarliest trails outside of Moab and surprise the guys in modified Jeeps. Even folks whose vans are too beautiful to beat up or whose vans have been damaged on the trail can have fun because most people welcome passengers. I always manage to meet new people this way, piling into the same van to drive an insane offroad track, to go hike a trail, or to swim at a swimming hole.</p>
                    <p>At camp, people let their friendly dogs run around in happy packs, and of course Rosie The Dog joined them.  The people gather around in groups to swap stories, play games, and geek out about the technical minutiae that comes with driving heavily modified obsolete vans on epic adventures. Everyone is eager to and show off van projects they completed over the last year and trail damage they sustained over the weekend. Everyone takes turns preparing large breakfasts and dinners for everyone else. At night, a handful of campfires spring up throughout the camp and people with different vibes gather around each. Some campfire rings involve drinking heavily. I always make interesting new friends. The stars are unreal. It is definitely one of the most beautiful places I have ever been.</p>
                    <p>This year, my wife Liza was still working, I had just quit my job, and my mom had just retired. When I asked my mom if she wanted to go with me, I was surprised she said yes! It was so much fun to share this experience with my mom. Everyone at the event loved her. She is so thoughtful and charismatic and full of great stories. She told me it was the first time she realized that Utah was beautiful and was the first time she enjoyed camping. I'm so thankful that I had long, uninterrupted stretches of time to just <em>be</em> with my awesome mom. I don't think I would have had the time and mental space to be with her properly if I was thinking about hurrying back to a job.</p>
                    <p>A lot of people at Syncro Solstice mentioned how great it was that I could spend this time with my mom because I wouldn't have this opportunity forever. Then they'd go into stories about what their mothers were like while they were still alive. They were right, and again I thought about the "Die With Zero" book talking about how once you leave one pool in the "waterfall of life" you cannot go back. </p>
