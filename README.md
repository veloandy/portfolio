# veloandy/portfolio-microsite

This is a cheesy little simple portfolio microsite I created to organize my thoughts and maybe help me with my job search.

It's all static HTML and stylesheets from [Foundation Framework](https://get.foundation/)

It doesn't use Node b/c it seems like every time I blink there are new critical security vulnerabilities discovered in `node_modules` of almost every project. I like the idea of being minimizing my risk while exposing this page to the world and ignoring it for a long time

I also like that this is simple enough to pick back up in two years to modify with no context.

Since this is just `index.html` plus a pile of assets and stylesheets, it should be easy to auto deploy.

Feel free to make a copy and play with it if it helps you.  Note that I'm licensing this under MIT.
